# Algorithms (Interview Preparation)

This folder contains **core algorithms** commonly asked in coding interviews.
The focus here is not just solving problems, but understanding the logic,
patterns, and when to apply each algorithm.

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Choosing the right algorithm for a problem  
- Optimizing brute force into efficient solutions  
- Building strong fundamentals for interviews  
- Writing clean and readable implementations  
- Analyzing time and space complexity

## 📝 Format used for each algorithm

Each algorithm entry generally includes:

1. **Concept + Intuition**
2. **When to use**
3. **Step-by-step approach**
4. **Complexity**
5. **Implementation**
6. **Related problems for practice**

## 📌 Goal of this folder

To build a strong and revision-friendly collection of algorithms that can be
quickly revisited before interviews.

Consistency matters more than speed — practice, revise, and improve. 🚀
