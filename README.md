# 🚀 Software Engineering Interview Preparation

This repository contains my **structured preparation for Software Engineering interviews**.
The focus is on **clear intuition, problem-solving patterns, and interview-ready implementations** rather than just brute-force solutions.

This repo acts as a **learning journal + revision guide** for technical interviews.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Master common **problem-solving patterns**
- Write **clean, optimized C++ code**
- Improve **explanation and reasoning skills**
- Prepare for **real interview scenarios**

## 🧠 Problem Documentation Format

Each problem generally includes:

- Problem statement (short)
- Intuition / thought process
- Approach
- Edge cases
- Optimized C++ solution
- Time & space complexity
- Possible interview follow-up questions

This mirrors **actual interview discussions**, not just final answers.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - STL & memory efficiency  
  - Recursion vs iteration  
  - BFS / DFS  
  - Greedy strategies  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Graph traversal & patterns  

---

## 📌 Preparation Philosophy

- Quality over quantity  
- Pattern recognition over memorization  
- Explanation before implementation  
- Interview-oriented thinking  

If you can **explain a solution clearly**, you truly understand it.

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- Actively solving and organizing problems  
- Adding System Design and Core CS notes gradually  
- Improving explanations and optimizations continuously  

This repository is a **living document** and will evolve with time.

---

## 🤝 How to Use This Repository

- Pick a topic and solve problems independently  
- Read intuition before code  
- Focus on why an approach works  
- Revisit topics regularly for revision  

---

## ⭐ Final Note

Interview preparation is not about solving thousands of problems,  
but about mastering **clarity, consistency, and confidence**.

This repository reflects my journey toward becoming an **interview-ready software engineer**.
